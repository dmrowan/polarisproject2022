# Polaris Project 2022: Characterizing a Non-Interacting Black Hole Candidate

## Project Goals

We are interested in studying black holes to learn more about the late stage evolution of massive stars and the underlying properties of compact objects. There are more than $10^6$ black holes in the Milky Way, but only a few dozen have been observed. 

The majority of stellar mass black holes are detected in X-ray binary systems or in gravitational wave mergers, but these systems represent a small fraction of possible binary configurations. Most black holes will be isolated or in non-interacting systems. Detecting these systems is difficult, since the black holes are electromagnetically dark, but not impossible. In this project we will work with radial velocity data and photometric data of a red giant star to determine the nature of its binary companion!

## Reading Scientific Papers

Section 3 of [Cooke et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12566) describes the questions one should try to answer while reading a paper:
* What is the specific problem this paper is investigating?
* To address this problem what did they observe and what specifically are they measuring?
* What was the primary result of their observations and how are these results novel?
